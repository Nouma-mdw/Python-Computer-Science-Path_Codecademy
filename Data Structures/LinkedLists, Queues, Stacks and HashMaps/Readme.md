# Blossom Project: Implementing HashMaps with blossom data in Python \ngiven define classes of nodes and linked lists  (see linkedlist_blosssom.py) the task is to implement a HshMap that takes in the data from blossom_lib.py (flowers and their meaning) and saves them as a map. \nIn the map the flower is the key and the  meaning the value, meaning that every flower can have at most one meaning. The key_value pairs get saved under an index caclulated with a hshing function ("sum(key.encode())") and in case of two keys having the same index, the collission prevention strategy is a separate  chaining with linked lists.

TIME COMPLEXITY:

 
GEEKS FOR GEEKS - Definition
"The valid algorithm takes a finite amount of time for execution. The time required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called time complexity  of the algorithm. Time complexity is very useful measure in algorithm analysis.

 It is the time needed for the completion of an algorithm. To estimate the time complexity, we need to consider the cost of each fundamental instruction and the number of times the instruction is executed."




SPACE COMPLEXITY:

GEEKS for GEEKS - Definition:
"Problem-solving using computer requires memory to hold temporary data or final result while the program is in execution. The amount of memory required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called space complexity of the algorithm.
The space complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of space taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. [...]
It is the amount of memory needed for the completion of an algorithm. To estimate the memory requirement we need to focus on two parts: 
	(1) A fixed part: It is independent of the input size. It includes memory for instructions (code), constants, variables, etc.
	(2) A variable part: It is dependent on the input size. It includes memory for recursion stack, referenced variables, etc.

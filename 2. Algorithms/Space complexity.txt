Examples for intuition:

 - "If in a a loop no new variables are created,
    the space complexity is O(1). e.g.
	def simple_loop(input_array):
	  for i in simple_array:
	    print(i)
    	it has time complexity of O(n) but 
	a space complexity of O(1)"

 - "Like with time complexity, space complexity denotes space growth
	in relation to the input size. It’s also important to note that
	space complexity usually refers to any additional space that will be needed,
	and doesn’t count the space of the input. So a function could have 10 arrays passed 	into it, but if all it does inside is print 'Hello World!', then it still takes O(1) 	space.

  -  "A recusrive function that is passed the same array or  object in each call
	doesn't add to the space complexity if the array or object is passed by reference
	(which it is in Python)."

  -  "Like time complexity, space complexity denotes space growth in relation to
	the input size. It's also importanto to not that space complexity usually
	refers to any additional space that will be needed, and doesn't count the space of the 	input. So a function could have 10 arrays passed into it, but  if all it does inside 	is print 'Hello World!', then it still takes O(1) space.


example: 
	def doublearray(input_array):
	  # Returns an array that is

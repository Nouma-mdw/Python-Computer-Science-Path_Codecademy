    "Timsort is a hybrid, stabel sorting algorithm, derived from merge srot and insertion sort, designed to perform well on many kinds of real_world data. It was implemented by Tim Peters in 2002 for use in the Python programming language. The algorithm finds subsequences of the data that are already ordered (runs) and uses them to sort the remainder more efficiently. This is done by merging runs until certain criteria is fulfilled. Timsort has been Python's standard orting algorithm since vesion 2.3. It is  also  used to sort arrays of non-primitive type in Java SE 7, on the Android platform, in GNU Octave, in V8, Swift and Rust.\n",
